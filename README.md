# Android_Bluetooth_RC_For_Arduino
This project contains an android app and the necessary Arduino sketch to control any Remote Control (RC) Device (car, plane, hovercraft) that uses two servos.


### Coming Soon
A second sketch to forward the bluetooth commands over larger distances ("nRF24L01+"-modules).
